# Deprecated
DN stepped up their game and introduced a "proper" paywall instead of justing hiding the content with CSS, so this plugin does no longer work.

# DN Paywall Remover
The paywall on dn.se is just some simple css rules hiding the content that is readily availble on the page. Now also supports the AdBlocker popup on SVD!
